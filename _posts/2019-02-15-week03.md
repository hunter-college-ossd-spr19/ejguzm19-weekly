This week I looked into different open source Projects

I looked at three different projects: 
Doxygen - which has 279,313 lines of code being developed since 1999.
Open Food Facts - which has a large number of users helping develop facts about food.
Netflix Conductor - which helps netflix orchestrate microservices.

Looking at these three different projects it made me realize how difficult and complex each project is. Looking at this projects I now know that I lack sufficient enough knowledge in programming to be able to make commits and changes. I know now that I need to find a project which, like open food facts has an active community and it is something that I can understand. Ones like Netflix Conductor is too complex and difficult for me to understand. 

For the next week I am going to look for an open source project which I am interested in and it is active. I do not want to find a project that I enjoy and not be able to make fixes or commits because people do not respond for two months. Also one that is not too complex.
