The three open source projects that i'd like to work on are:

[Godot] - game engine
(https://github.com/godotengine/godot)

Godot is a game engine which is exactly what I wanted to work on. The engine itself is fairly advanced but I would like to take the time to learn and figure out how it works. Looking at their github page I am confident that I will be able to contribute. I am excited to look into this project and learn about how it works. 

[Nextcloud Server](https://github.com/nextcloud/server)

Nextcloud Server is a project that will help me delve into programming in the cloud. Learning how to program cloud servers will be helpful to me in the future. Since most companies are using cloud servers rather than having hardware it will be helpful for me to take this opportunity to learn more about cloud programming.

[Microsoft AirSim] - Simulator for autonomous vehicles built on Unreal Engine
(https://github.com/Microsoft/AirSim)

Airsim is a project I am also really excited for. It deals with creating a simulator for drones, cars, and other things. Being built on the Unreal Engine. I plan on studying AI in the future, and the project goal is to develop AirSim as a platform for AI research to experiment with deep learning and reinforcement learning algorithms for autonomous vehicles. Being apart of this project will help me learn about AI and honestly i'll enjoy just messing around with AirSim during the process.
