This week I looked at the project for which I plan on studying the rest of this semester. The project is called nextcloud server. While trying to set up the development environment I looked up these three issues which I think it will be benificial to tackle.

1. Issue where number of user is negative:

2. Issue with uploading files with 4 level hiearchy. 
	
	This issue is important to look at to undestand how the program work. Since the files still get uploaded and this is only happening on the web version then it is easier to track down where the issue may be occuring. 
	
3. The object shares first contact if field is empty.

	This issue is also easy to recreate. As for the fix to the code it deals with mainly reading code. The solution seems to be to find where the code is for inputing those contacts and figuring out why it is putting the first contact.
