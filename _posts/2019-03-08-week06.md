2. Issue with uploading files with 4 level hiearchy. 
https://github.com/nextcloud/server/issues/14506

	This issue is also easy to recreate. As for the fix to the code it deals with mainly reading code. The solution seems to be to find where the code is for inputing those contacts and figuring out why it is putting the first contact.
