**Last Weeks Goals:** 

   
    For next week, I plan to get help with understanding this code from someone who 
    has more experience, and also try to at the very least get the button on the 
    summary page, whether it works or not. 


Unfortunately, I failed last week's goal, because I was not able to get a button on the summary page. The good thing though was that I was able to learn a lot about the code in the environment. While searching for how to write type script I found this image: 

![TypeScript Chart](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/400/1*IP44ejhk2c78Nt_xUckWbw.png). 

This image has helped me understand some of how the code works. I have been using [this website](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/how-to-set-up-a-typescript-project-67b427114884) to learn more about Type Script.

While working on this issue ([Validate more than 5 recordings:](https://github.com/mozilla/voice-web/issues/1869)), I thought that it would be simply a matter of copying some code and pasting it. I now know that it will not be that simple. When I attempted to copy the code from one file to the next, I kept getting many different errors. To start, some code from the first file had imported different libraries. When I went through and imported all the libraries, I found that it still wasn't working. I ended up having issues with the code itself. After going through the long process of figuring which libraries were needed and how to import them, I noticed that there were certain variables defined in the first file that were not defined in the second file. Thus, making it entirely impossible to copy the code from one file to the other.  

While messing with these files I noticed a pattern though. Most of the code itself had reoccurring syntax. I was able to make a connection with how things were written on the files. Now instead of trying to copy and paste one code to another I will try to create some myself. I will still be essentially following by the example in the settings.tsx file to be able to make the new code in the sucess.tsx file.  

For next week focus on learning what these terms meant in the code. 

...props 

Localized id 

interface 

render() 

return ( 

export 


Although some of these terms seem pretty obvious like return or render, I need to figure out what they actually do in the code. For example, below is a line a code that is in the bottom of each tsx file. I am not sure what it is used for, but it is something that I want to understand before making changes.  

    export default connect<PropsFromState>(({ api, user }: StateTree) => ({ 
        api, 
        user, 
    }))(Success); 

 
Lastly, I really need to start making progress with his code, I plan on visiting my professor to ask for help and see if I am going on the right track. This weekend I will attempt to at the very least change something in the code. Each time I tried to change something this week I ended up just breaking the build and having to reset my branch and changes. It may be entirely possible that this issue may be too ambitious for me, but I do really want to continue trying, I don't want to give up on it.  
 

(Another side note, I will also start a dialogue on the git website and slack about my ideas for these changes)
